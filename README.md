# The Intelligent Pixel
###Overview
The purpose of this project is to extend the range of knowledge in the processes around simple survival strategies, and the results are delivered in both visual and summary of statistics. The standard way of thinking about a survival strategy has been oriented around short term goals and benefits seen in natural environments with natural beings. However, Machine Learning and Predictive Data Analytics, the rational decisions of choosing paths(plans) to target features can be rationalized further into the future with greater detail and certainty. With particular environments and agents, a simulation can accelerate our understanding of the issues of synonymous situations in the real world. To keep things simple for now, one arbitrary environment(Game of Life) and agent(Intelligent Pixel) will be studied.
